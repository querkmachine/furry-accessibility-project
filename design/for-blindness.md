Blindness is a significant or complete lack of ability to see. Blindness can be present from birth, obtained through injury or develop naturally over time.

Blind users benefit most from webpages that are written in semantically correct, logically ordered code and clearly written content that includes text alternatives.

## Assistive technology usage
A blind user may navigate through a website using a [keyboard](/technology/keyboard), using [voice control](/technology/voice-control), or with specialised [braille displays](/technology/braille-displays).

### Not all setups are the same
It is not uncommon for users with low or no vision to disable images and stylesheets from loading in their browser, as these provide no useful benefit to them.

Blind users may not use a visual display with their computer at all, and solely use keyboard navigation and their screen reader to complete tasks.
