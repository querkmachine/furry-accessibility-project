Low vision is a deficiency in one’s ability to see, but one not so severe as to be considered blindness. Like blindness, low vision can be present from birth, be acquired through injury, or develop naturally at any part of a person’s life.

This includes people who may have relatively little impairment, such as those who need to wear glasses for reading, to people with more significant vision problems, such as cataracts or [visual snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow). 

Low vision users benefit most from large text sizes, being able to zoom in and out of a page, and having a clear contrast between text colour and background colour.

## Assistive technology usage

People with vision impairment may make more use of zoom settings, use [screen magnifiers](/technology/screen-magnifiers/), and [customise the appearance of pages](/technology/user-styles-high-contrast-modes/) to change the colours or fonts used.

Many people with visual impairments do not use screen readers, as their eyesight is still good enough for most day-to-day activities, however those with more severe impairments may use them. 22% of screen reader users report having some form of vision impairment.
