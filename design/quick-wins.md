These are some ‘quick wins’ that are typically easy to implement and provide a benefit to most website users, regardless of disability.

Do:

- Write semantic and logically ordered HTML.
- Give interactive elements, such as links, buttons and form inputs, clear focus states.
- Associate form inputs with text labels.
- Provide a link to skip to the main content of a page at the top of the page.
- Provide alt text for images.
- Make functionality work regardless of device or input method.

Don't:

- Rely solely on colour to convey information or state.
- Hijack or override the default browser functionality, such as using scrolljacking.
- Enforce a particular appearance, such as using `!important` styles or disabling zoom.
- Hide significant amounts of content in a way that requires user interaction to view it, such as in sliders or accordions.
- Force users to have to use particular devices, or use them in a particular way, such as making content only available on the desktop version of a site.
