There is some debate regarding whether using the word ‘disabled’ is appropriate to describe individuals with physical, mental or developmental issues that differ from 'normal'. 

This document uses the word freely instead of using other terminology such as ‘handicapable’, ‘special needs’ or ‘differently abled’, as many disabled people find these terms patronising and an obfuscation of the issues that they live with.

I would recommend looking at [the UK Government's guidance on writing about disabilities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/inclusive-language-words-to-use-and-avoid-when-writing-about-disability) for specific examples.
