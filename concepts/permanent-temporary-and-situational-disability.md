title: Permanent, temporary and situational disability
---

‘Disabled’ is not a term restricted to people in wheelchairs. It can apply to non-disabled people too, such as following an injury or in particular everyday situations.

## Permanent disabilities

Permanent disabilities are disabilities that a person will likely have for the rest of their life, and may have had since birth. 

There may be ways for a person to account for their disability (such as using a prosthetic, in the case of a missing limb), but the underlying disability is persistent.

## Temporary disabilities

Temporary disabilities are disabilities that, with time or treatment, can be resolved. These disabilities are usually acquired somehow, such as due to injury, medical treatment, or as a side effect to medication.

Although temporary, the disability may persist for months or years, depending on the severity.

## Situational disabilities

Situational disabilities are disabilities that are specific to certain circumstances. 

Although not a disability in the traditional sense, they mimic disability by virtue of being a limitation on an individual's current abilities. These circumstances might be easy to change, while other times they might not.
