## Can you help me make my site accessible?

Sure! If you're involved in a furry (or brony) fandom project, I offer free, no-strings-attached accessibility audits.

These are timeboxed to a couple of hours and generally cover fewer than a dozen pages (auditing can be incredibly time-consuming). I try to focus on the most important pages and those mostly likely to be used by users.

I'll produce a report summarising my findings and what parts of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines they fail. If you want, I can also provide implementation suggestions for specific problems.

[Email hi@berly.kim](mailto:hi@berly.kim) with questions or enquiries.

If your project is open source and available publicly, such as on GitHub, then I might even contribute directly!

## Why a guide specifically for furries?

Good point. Pretty much all of the information in this guide is relevant to all websites, not furry ones specifically.

I chose to aim the guide at furries for a few reasons:

1. Pretty much all furry fandom projects are built and maintained by volunteers; consequentially they lack the resources, expertise, or staff retention to implement and maintain accessibile experiences.
2. There is significantly less expertise in front-end development and accessibility design in the fandom compared to "more technical" areas like software development or network administration.
3. A lot of furries are disabled, neurodivergent, or are frequently situationally disabled (e.g. wearing a fursuit). There is a clear need for better accessibility standards within the fandom.

Many guides work on the assumption that the reader is either not technical or that they're already experienced in front-end development.

## How do I know you know what you're talking about?

Do I have formal training or qualifications in web accessibility? No. But I have been making websites since 2003, doing website development professionally for over a decade, and I got a university degree saying I'm pretty good at it to boot. I've also worked (or still work) on several online projects for the furry and brony fandoms. 

I'm currently a front-end developer at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), the department of the UK Government that handles government-wide IT projects, where I work on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk), a service used by hundreds of people across dozens of government departments.

As a provider of public services (and provider of a service to other public services), we need to take accessibility very seriously. People can't opt-out of or choose to use a different government website, after all! We need to account for everybodyâ€”even excluding 1% of the population would be equivalent to excluding the entire population of Sheffield (the UK's fourth largest city).

Prior to working in government, I was the lead front-end developer and accessibility advocate at private sector development agency, working for clients ranging from charities and healthcare services to conferences and local government. For many of these projects, ensuring fair access was not only a moral obligation, but a legal one.

I can't claim to be a total expert in accessibility, but I know enough to make things better, and I know when to defer to those who know more.

## This website sucks.

Maybe, but at least it's accessible.
