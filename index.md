title: Web accessibility for furries
subtitle: A reference guide to making furry websites accessible.
---

When some people think of web accessibility they think of high contrast colour schemes and screen readers. Those are important, but the discipline of accessibility is much further reaching than that. Motor issues, autism and even a propensity for motion sickness are all things that affect how people use a website, and they are just as important to accommodate as the blind and hard of sight.

Hello! I'm Kimberly Grey. I'm a front-end developer and web accessibility expert who just happens to also be [a furry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom), and I'm on a crusade to make furry websites accessible.

To that end, I've written this guide. It's aimed at the demographic most common on furry projects: volunteers with technical expertise, but not necessarily any knowledge in front-end website development or accessibility design. There's more about that on [the questions and answers page](/questions-and-answers).

It is not intended to be comprehensive or authoritative. Disability covers an infinitely diverse spectrum of limitations, needs and wants. **The only way to be sure that a website can be used by any single person, is to ask that person to use it!**

## Using this guide

I don't expect everyone to read the whole thing. I don't expect *most* people to read the whole thing. I've tried to keep things short and to the point, summarise information into lists and short sections, and make each page largely stand alone from the rest.

It's also a work in progress. Perpetually. The evolution of browsers, specifications and assistive technologies is neverending. I'll try, and probably fail, to keep this guide completely up-to-date. If you notice any mistakes or omissions, please let me know.
