Screen magnifiers are a tool that allows a user to zoom and pan into areas of the screen, making it easier for people with [low vision](/design/for-low-vision) to view content.

Optical magnifiers—large lenses that attach to the front of a screen—and video magnifiers—which use a camera and dedicated screen—are also available.

Page zooming is a web browser-specific feature that performs the same function for webpages only. 

## Availability

All modern operating systems include a software screen magnifier, including [Magnifier on Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198), [Zoom on iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e367e/ios), [Zoom on macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210978), and [Magnification on Android](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006949).

All modern web browsers support zooming, typically accessible through menu options or using keyboard shortcuts. 

Some browsers also allow users to increase or decrease the size of text, which changes the size of text without changing other aspects of the page. Both zooming and text size alterations must be accommodated to be compliant with WCAG.
