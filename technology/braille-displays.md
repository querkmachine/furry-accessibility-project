Refreshable braille displays (sometimes called braille terminals) are a hardware device that translates text from a computer or device into [braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille), allowing it to be read by people who are [blind](/design/for-blindness) or have [low vision](/design/for-low-vision).

Braille displays are more likely to be used by deafblind people who are unable to use alternative assistive technologies, like [screen readers](/technology/screen-readers).

## Availability

Braille displays are traditionally large and expensive, limiting usage to desktop applications. Light and portable displays are increasingly common, however they remain expensive, frequently costing anywhere from £500 to £9,000.

Braille display support is incorporated in some operating systems:

- [braille input is supported by Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/chapter-8-using-narrator-with-braille-3e5f065b-1c9d-6eb2-ec6d-1d07c9e94b20) in conjunction with the Narrator screen reader
- compatible braille displays can be used alongside the [BrailleBack app for Android](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/3535226?hl=en)
- [compatible braille displays can be used with macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover/cpvobrailledisplays/mac)
- [compatible braille displays can be used with iOS and iPadOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202514)
- iOS and iPadOS also support [braille input using the touchscreen](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210066) in conjunction with the VoiceOver screen reader

## Specific considerations

### Don't rely on certain keyboard layouts

Braille displays often incorporate keyboards so that users can read and type without having to move between two separate devices. 

There is no standard layout for braille keyboards. The most common keyboard layouts include:

- Perkins/Mountbatten brailler: Six keys conforming to the six dots of a standard braille cell, with additional space, backspace, and return (new line) keys. Multiple keys are pressed at once to type each letter.
- Eight-dot braillers: Similar to the above, these have eight keys for entering characters corresponding to the eight-dot braille code, which is capable of representing a greater range of characters.
- Conventional QWERTY: More recently, some braille displays come with full QWERTY keyboard layouts.

Both Perkins/Mountbatten and eight-dot braillers may include additional keys for the user's convenience, such as a separate number pad or added function keys. 

As a braille keyboard user is not guaranteed to have a full keyboard layout available, you shouldn't depend on a user being able to use specific keys, key combinations, or shortcuts in order to navigate a page's content. 

### Input is not always output

Braille text is not a one-to-one representation of the text given, and includes several shorthands and control characters that make it distinct from printed English. This makes it faster for users to read and write common words. 

For example, the word 'afternoon' is typically shortened to ⠁⠋⠝ (a-f-n), 'name' has the dedicated shorthand ⠐⠝ (typically transcribed as dot-n), whilst 'and' has a dedicated character: ⠯.

Braille also includes various control characters not present in standard English, including ⠠ (the following is a capital) and ⠼ (the following is a number).

## Testing

Unfortunately given the expense and requirement to know braille, it is incredibly difficult to ensure that content is suitable for a braille display.
