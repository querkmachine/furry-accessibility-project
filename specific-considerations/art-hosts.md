- Doing alternate text for images is very difficult due to being user-generated content.
  - Consider providing the ability for uploaders to add their own alternate text.
- Written works
  - PDFs are generally poor for accessibility unless the author has made specific considerations when designing the document.
  - Consider providing a writing interface with some (limited) rich-text editing so that written work can be directly input and rendered on page. (FIMFiction has a very good one.)
  - Yes, this takes away some formatting control from the author, but the reader having formatting control is much more important.
